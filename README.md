# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee needs help to complete an election audit of the recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who receieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Get a unique list of counties where voting occurred. 
7. Caculate the total number of votes from each county. 
8. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county.
9. Determine which county had the largest voting turnout.

## Overview of Election Audit
The challenge for this Python lesson was to obtain the voter turnout and percentage of votes of each county in the election, and then determine the county with the highest voter turnout. This built on the same coding techniques that were needed to calculate similar voting metrics for the election candidates (total votes and percentage of votes per candidate, and the winning candidate), as presented in Module 3.  The deliverables of this analysis were to print the results both on the command line and in a separate text file. 

The data file provided for this analysis was a [csv file](Resources/election_results.csv) with three columns: Ballot ID, County, and Candidate. The analysis was done in a python file (`.py`), and then it prints to both the terminal and a seperate text file (`.txt`) when the python file is run.
